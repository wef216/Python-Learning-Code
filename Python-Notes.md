# Data Model in Python

## The Python Data Model
The python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations, triggered by special syntax.

*i.e* `__getitem__` supports the syntax `obj[key]`

The special method allow your **object** to implement, support, and interact with basic language constructs such as:
- **Iteration**
- **Collections**
- **Attribute access**
- **Operator overloading**
- **Function and method invocation**
- **Object creation and destruction**
- **String representation and formatting**
- **Managed context**
